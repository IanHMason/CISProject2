              A brain injury is unpredictable in its consequences. It affects who we are and the way we think, act, and feel. 
              It can change everything about us in a matter of seconds.

                <li>A person with a brain injury is a person first.</li>

                <li>The effects of a brain injury vary from person to person.</li>
                <li>They depend on factors such as cause, location, and severity.</li>

              There are two types of acquired brain injury: traumatic and non-traumatic.<br><br>
              <strong>Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)</strong> is caused by an external force altering brain function.<br><br>
              <strong>Non-Traumatic Brain Injury</strong> results from internal factors such as lack of oxygen, exposure to toxins, or pressure from a tumor.

        <h3 class="subheading">More Than My Brain Injury: Dylan’s Story</h3>
        <p><strong>As a survivor, Dylan Flynn believes he’s in the “ideal position to spread awareness and raise money to help individuals struggling with brain injury.”</strong></p>
        <p>  
          Dylan Flynn, brain injury survivor and advocate, has always had a love of music. When Dylan was a freshman in high school,
          he purchased his first bass guitar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as he was planning to start a band with his friends, he was in a terrible car accident and was in a coma for 12 days.
          Initially, doctors told his family he wouldn’t survive and that he would spend the rest of his life in a nursing home.
        </p>
        <p>
          Defying the odds, Dylan walked out of rehab 10 weeks later and was able to return to school for his sophomore year.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result of his brain injury, Dylan has epilepsy, memory difficulties, anxiety, and depression. Despite these symptoms,
          he eventually earned his GED and sought to do something meaningful with his time.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the recommendation of a friend, he started a campaign called <strong>Pass the Bass</strong> as a way to use his love of music
          to increase awareness of brain injury. Through Pass the Bass, Dylan attends music concerts and asks the performing band
          to play one song with his bass guitar. He is often invited on stage to tell his story.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Dylan’s life may not have gone as planned, he enjoys being part of the music scene. Dylan embodies BIAA’s newest
          campaign, <strong>#MoreThanMyBrainInjury</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I’d wanted to make a living as a musician. Although I am unfortunately not taking part in the actual music at these shows,
          music is still a very big part of my life thanks to this campaign. I love watching my bass be played and have had the honor
          of watching some of my favorite bassists [play] with mine.”
        </p>
        <p>
          One of Dylan’s goals through his campaign was to fundraise for the Brain Injury Association of America (BIAA).
          He decided to design <strong>Pass the Bass</strong> merchandise, which he sells at each concert he attends.
          The money he raises from sales is donated to BIAA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Dylan’s brain injury prevented him from doing exactly what he’d wanted to do with his life,
          he still found a way to merge his passion with his daily living and says that other survivors should try to do the same.
